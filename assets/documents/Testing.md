## HTML

- Ran HTML code through [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) for code warning & error check.
 - Everything is coded properly. Few Warning message were received:
 - **Warning**, there was an unnecessary type attribute for JavaScript resources (the attribute was removed)
 - **Warning**, there was an empty headings for h2 id="confirmation-title" and h3 id="confirmation-title-email". As they are used to display confirmation message on form submit, they are left empty.
 - **Error**, there was empty value for attribute src on element img. As it is used as a placeholder for the Gallery light box image, everything is left as it is.
