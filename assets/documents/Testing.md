## HTML

 - Ran HTML code through HTML Validator
 - Received error messages for p-tags inside iframes not being permitted. Removed the paragraph and text as iframes are supported in all browsers. Added Title to each iframe with description for screen-reader accessibility.
 - Warning for Intro section lacking heading. As this is an image gallery, no heading is required.
 - Warning for "empty heading" for the About section. The H3 tag with class of "countryHeading" pulls in the relevant heading from the REST country API so this can be ignored.
 - Two warnings for "The type attribute is unnecessary for JavaScript resources". Deleted both instances after researching correct measures.

## CSS
 - Ran CSS code through CSS Validator
   - No errors found.

## JavaScript
