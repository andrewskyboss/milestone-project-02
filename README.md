![picture of site](assets/images/responsive-1.PNG)
- Hey Travel is a website, where user can find a holiday destination for their needs. For their convenience, there are Map with proposed destinations markers. As well, user can choose a travel package from this website. To get inspiration about destinations, there are lot of visual materials placed in different manner, such as Hero sliders, Grid images and Gallery. As well, user has form to contact website owner to get all necessary information.

- Despite to the existing travel situation, people still wants to travel. They are looking for new destinations and possibilities to go out from home. That is mean that any Travel and destinations websites, this version as well, has very high commercial feature. It has modern design and lot of visual component. Design was build using last UI/UX technologies.

- Meet the target audience users’ needs using UI/UX design principles
- Implement front-end interactivity, using core JavaScript, JavaScript libraries and/or Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
- Test an interactive front-end web application through the development, implementation and deployment stages
- Deploy an interactive front-end web application to a Cloud platform
- Demonstrate and document the development process through a version control system
- Learn JavaScript theory and practically implement all gained knowledge

#### User Goals

- The main users of this website are a business people and their representatives.

Common types of users are:
- New customers. The users’ main goal is to get necessary travel information. They are ready for travel and can spend some time to choose a destination. They are ready to get some inspirations from the imaginary and customers’ reviews.

### Design Choices

This project was built based on UX concerns: website should be useful, usable and valuable for the customer and owner. As well to get a positive user experience, were used process of five planes of user experience:
- **Strategy Plane**  – represents business goals. The main website owner goals were presented above. Just a reminder, that main user of this website will be a business people. Whole design should be kept simple in classical style with some bright elements (in this project Imperial Red color plays as bright element). Design should be plain and modern. Information should be well structured and easy to access. Main parts of the information are placed into top navigation. No more than 3 clicks to get information about website owner. Download button is placed in a footer navigation to get CV printable copy.

- **Scope plane** - represents features we want to include into design. 
  - This project includes following features: 
     - Header navigation.
      - Mobile navigation.
      - Intuitive design.
      - SVG logo on top of the page.
      - Hero Slider.
      - Image Gallery with modal pop up window
      - Grid images as a visual representatives.
      - Google Map with location markers.
      - Contact form.
      - Social media icons.


- **Structure plane** - Information in this project is structured and logically placed into main parts. All parts placed to the navigation. Exception is for Packages. They are not in the navigation and can be accessed through the destinations page. As well, main navigation elements are placed on the homepage into grid system and complimented by the images.

- **Skeleton plane** - part for mock-ups:
  - Wireframes links are presented below:
   - [Link to a Wireframes for a Desctop view](assets/documents/desctop.pdf)
   - [Link to a Wireframes for Tablet view ](assets/documents/tab.pdf)
   - [Link to a Wireframes for Mobile view ](assets/documents/mobile.pdf)

- **Surface plane** - it is a final part of design procedure. The project is built in Classical design style with infusions of modern elements. Abril Fatface font gives additional modern design inclusions. This font curves are not traditional for Travel websites design. It looks more from fashion magazine designs and brings more stylish look. Pale Shades of Blue, Red and green are very pleasant. Colors are associated with water, sun and summer grass. Images are very colourful and attract attention. Website gives a holydays feeling. Same as semi-transparent and grey backgrounds, sliding and fade in animation gives lightweight and elegance.

#### Colors
The main inspiration of the colors started from the Oxford Blue color.

By the [empower-yourself-with-color-psychology.com website](https://www.empower-yourself-with-color-psychology.com/blue-in-business.html#:~:text=Blue%20is%20the%20most%20universally,indicates%20confidence%2C%20reliability%20and%20responsibility.) 
"Blue is the most universally favored color of all and therefore the safest to use. It relates to trust, honesty and dependability, therefore helping to build customer loyalty. Blue indicates confidence, reliability and responsibility"
- As a major color, the Oxford Blue (#0A0E29) is responsible to create a trust feeling from an employer to a potential employee. 
- Space Cadet (#2D325A) is a same blue group color and gives a variety and lighter shade. 
- Secondary color is Imperial Red (#F71735). As a shade of red, gives us feeling of energy, passion and action. It’s important to show a creativity and energy for a potential employer. 
- Accent color is Gold Metallic (#DBB13B). As a shade of yellow should create a feeling of success, achievement and triumph. 
- Pale Purple Pantone (#F1E4F3) color is a neutral and combines all colors together
- Combination of those colors should create emotional trust and future potential. Those feelings and website content should help the Author to achieve his goals to be hired.

- Color palete was created using [Coolors resources](https://coolors.co)
- ![color scheme](assets/images/colors.PNG)

#### Typography
- Elegant Quicksand sans-serif typeface family font, were using in this project for the body text.
- Abril Fatface font is universal and contemporary style font, displays strong presence on the page to attract attention was using for all titles in this project.

- Body font is Quicksand 16px. This body font size is common for many project as easy to read and good for design as well.
- All titles are in Abril Fatface font’s family. This font is based on classical Proportions and has variety of sizes. H1 as main title is in size of 40px. It is quite big size, but looks very elegant. H2 title is in size of 35px. H3 and H4 titles are in same size of 30px.
- All fonts are reduced in size for mobile devices to fit into the small screen of devices:
- H1 = 40px, H2 = 35px, H3 = 27px.
- body font is in same size for mobile devices.

- Font examples are presented below:
